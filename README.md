# Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions (Opera)

## Task Overview

This project involves identifying and removing potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions in **Opera** to improve performance and protect user privacy.

---

## Tools Used

- **Opera Web Browser**
- **Opera Extension Manager**
- Web search (for extension reviews, e.g., Chrome Web Store, Opera Add-ons)

---

## Steps Followed

### 1. Open Extension Manager in Opera
- Navigated to: `Menu (O) > Extensions > Extensions`
- OR used the shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + E`

### 2. Reviewed All Installed Extensions
- Checked the name, icon, and description of each extension.

### 3. Inspected Permissions & Reviews
For each extension:
- Clicked **Details**
- Checked:
  - Permissions (e.g., “Read your browsing history”)
  - Reviews on Opera Add-ons and Chrome Web Store
  - Publisher authenticity

### 4. Identified Suspicious or Unused Extensions
Criteria used:
- Unknown publishers
- Overreaching permissions (e.g., clipboard access, site data)
- No clear purpose or misleading name
- Low ratings or very few downloads

### 5. Removed Suspicious/Unnecessary Extensions
- Clicked **Remove** on identified extensions

### 6. Restarted Opera
- Fully closed and reopened browser
- Monitored for performance improvements

### 7. Researched Potential Risks
Malicious browser extensions can:
- Act as spyware (track browsing)
- Inject advertisements
- Steal credentials or financial data
- Redirect search traffic
- Install additional malware

## Post-Cleanup Outcome

- Opera browser performance improved (faster load and response)
- No more unexpected ads or search redirects
- Slight reduction in memory usage

## Security Tip

Always verify:
- The developer/publisher of the extension

- The permissions requested

Avoid extensions that:
- Claim to offer unrelated features (e.g., “Free Movies”)
- Have vague or no descriptions
- Request access to all site data without justification
